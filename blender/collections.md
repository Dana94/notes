# Collections

Used to organize your scene and objects.

Right click -&gt; New... to make a new collection. It's advised to rename it to avoid confusion.

You can also nest collections in one another if a collection's objects is a part of a bigger collection, like a mesh used in the background of your scene.

Before creating a new object, make sure to select "Scene Collection" so you don't accidentally add an object to another collection you just selected previously.
