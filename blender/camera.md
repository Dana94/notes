# Camera

In camera settings: 

resolution &gt; x and y mean width and height, respectively.



viewport display &gt; composition &gt; thirds 

this will split the camera view into a 3 x 3 grid. It helps with moving your objects around to reach the right balance in the camera's view.



Orthographic lens for low-poly scenes - it sort of fades out the background as it gets farther from the camera.



Add an Object &gt; Empty and have it in the center of the scene, then deselect it. Then select the camera \(first!\) then hold down shift and select the empty so both objects are selected. Hit **Ctrl + p** and select **object**. You assign the camera as the parent of the empty \(I think...\). You will see a dotted line connecting the 2 objects together. Rotating the empty \(only having this selected now\) on the z-axis will show the camera following its rotation.
