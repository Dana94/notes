# Glossy and Diffuse Shaders

### Glossy BSDF

RGBA - How much of the color to reflect

Roughness - Controls how reflective and how much noise shows, rays in random direction

GGX - default

Multiscatter GGX - takes into account the light bouncing out after bouncing around, a bit more accurate if roughness is high

**Ctrl + B** to select a part to render in viewport
