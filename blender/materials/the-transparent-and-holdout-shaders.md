# The Transparent and Holdout Shaders

### Transparent

Easiest material - color to choose, how much light is being passed though and how much is being absorbed. So absorbing everything except that color.

Can be used to make holograms.

Can look like glass.

If using EVEE these settings need to be added:

Toggle "show backface" depending on a completely transparency or not.

### Holdout

Block out everything behind it as well.

A render image will completely remove anything using the holdout shader.
