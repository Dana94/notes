# General

A set of instructions to tell render engine what to do with the light when it hits the surface.



For materials:

* create a slot and select current color as base to use
* unlink it by pressing the "2" value so it doesn't change the original color it's copied from.



Ctrl + L to select all faces connected or linked.

Click on any face in the base, then ctrl + L will highlight the whole base

If you want to convert the 2 separate colored meshed to the other, just change their assigned colors to each-other.

If the material has a 0 next to its name in the material selector for too long, Blender may delete it to save up space.

Duplicating mesh objects makes their materials separate too.

You're allowed to reassign the material another color without affecting the other model, until you change the color itself, then both objects show the change.

Alt + D on an object to make an instance. Editing an instance's materials placement will affect the original object too. You can overwrite this by changing from data to object.
