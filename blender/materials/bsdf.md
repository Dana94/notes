# BSDF

A set of instructions to tell render engine what to do with the light when it hits the surface.



For materials:

* create a slot and select current color as base to use
* unlink it by pressing the "2" value so it doesn't change the original color it's copied from.



Ctrl + L to sect all faces a part of one type of the mesh

Click on any face in the base, then ctrl + L will highlight the whole base
