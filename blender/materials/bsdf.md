# BSDF

A set of instructions to tell render engine what to do with the light when it hits the surface.



For materials:

* create a slot and select current color as base to use
* unlink it by pressing the "2" value so it doesn't change the original color it's copied from.



Ctrl + L to select all faces connected or linked.

Click on any face in the base, then ctrl + L will highlight the whole base

If you want to convert the 2 separate colored meshed to the other, just change their assigned colors to each-other.

If the material has a 0 next to its name in the material selector for too long, Blender may delete it to save up space.
