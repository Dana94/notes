# Fresnel

More reflective from an angle rather than straight on.

The **principled BSDF** has it.

Without it, use **Fresnel** or **Layer Weight** for the same affect.

IOR: 1.6 is best for this.

Metal example:

Whether you connect the mix shader or the glass by itself, the results are the same.

Decreasing the roughness in this example shows more/less fresnel.
