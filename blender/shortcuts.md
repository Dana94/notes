Useful when selecting the sides of a circle mesh. Extrude, then immediately resize it to give the specified distance.

## Ctrl + Alt + 0

Sets the camera's viewing angle to your location, assuming you have a camera in your scene.

## 0

Look through camera view.

## Shift + ~

Select camera first, then use this tool to move it. There are more ways to move the camera than this one, it's a bit slow to me.

Use the w, s, a, d keys or the up, left, right, down arrows to move the camera.
