# Sculpting

I'm pretty new to sculpting. 

There are some things that can't be built by simply putting mesh objects together. Sculpting can lead to more realistic models with practice and determination.

With that being said, the first thing you need to keep in mind before sculpting mesh is to right-click on the object in Layout mode and select "Shade Smooth". It's strange, but its not really explained that this step is necessary in order to sculpt the object.

### Shortcuts

F - changes the size of the brush - also can adjust the radius in the toolbar.

Ctrl - will give the opposite effect the brush would normally do. For example, the blob brush can add or subtract. By default, it adds. Holding down ctrl will activate subtract. The opposite affect can also be activated in the toolbar.

Shift + F - changes strength

Ctrl + i - inverts mask selection

Alt + m - clear mask selection

Sculpt &gt; set pivot &gt; pivot to mask border for posing \(like limbs\)

### Brushes

* Grab - Click anywhere on the object and while holding down, move the mouse to drag a piece of the object. The change is subtle.
* Snake Hook - This is a stronger "grab" tool. 
* Blob - Make a circular motion with the cursor while holding down n a part of the mesh and you'll see the surface "blow up". This can make spherical indents in the mesh.
* Draw - Drag the cursor back and forth as if you're drawing. The object will be pulled in the direction the cursor is going.
* Scrape - set to original: normal and original: plane
* Mask - borders off selections that won't be affected by sculpting \(A key to get more options\)
  * Shift + R to repeat last mask brush you used
  * Shift + Ctrl + left click for lasso tool
