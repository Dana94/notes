# 12 Principles of Animation

[Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDqjIdI4bF4) 

1. **Squash & Stretch**

   Objects get longer and flatter to emphasize their speed, momentum, weight, mass. More squash/stretch shows a softer object, rather than stiff. Stretching is used just before impact \(like a ball hitting the ground\) rather than throughout the animation.  

2. **Anticipation**

   Character prepares an action to give viewers an idea to what will happen next. Like when a spring coils up before expanding. There can be more than 1 level of anticipation during an action scene.  

3. **Staging**

   Presenting an idea clear to the viewer. Acting, setting, camera angle, timing.

   Camera zoomed out for actions, zoomed in for expressions. Have writing long enough on the screen to be read 3 times. Exaggerate the scene to emphasize what you're trying to convey.  

4. **Straight Ahead & Pose to Pose** Ways to animate frames. Straight Ahead: draw the next immediate pose after the first one. Good for unpredictable animation like fire or water. Pose to Pose is when the first and last frame are drawn and you keep dividing the timeline until all the frames are done. Generally better for control for most actions or knowing how to draw the hair or clothes for a character after the body poses are done.  first poses: **keys** second poses: **extremes** further down poses that connect extremes to keys: **breakdowns** 
5. Follow Through & Overlapping Action \(Drag\) **Follow Through**: Parts of body continue to move after body has stopped. **Overlapping Action**: Offset between tie of main body and its other parts. **Drag**: technique of delaying overlapping action with its other parts. When a body moves, the tip of the appendage should be the last things to catch up. When the body stops, the tip should follow through the farthest before moving back. This can also emphasize the object's mass.
