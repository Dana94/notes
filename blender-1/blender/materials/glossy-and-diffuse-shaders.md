# Glossy and Diffuse Shaders

### Glossy BSDF

RGBA - How much of the color to reflect

Roughness - Controls how reflective and how much noise shows, rays in random direction

GGX - default

Multiscatter GGX - takes into account the light bouncing out after bouncing around, a bit more accurate if roughness is high

**Ctrl + B** to select a part to render in viewport

**Ctrl + Alt + B** to undo it

### Diffuse Shader

Glossy shader with roughness of 1.0 = diffuse shader

Increase roughness removes the shine in the edges \(frenal\)



Node Wrangler add-on is activated.

**Ctrl + shift** to click on a node and have it immediately connected to the material output.
