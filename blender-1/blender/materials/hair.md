# Hair

Particle settings for hair

* **children > interpolated > length** (distance of hair from the surface)
* **children > interpolated > threshold** (how much breaks through from surface)
* **children > interpolated > kink** (**frequency** - size of cloud shape, **amplitude**: intensity/amount of effect)'

Add shader (when adding light to a material) when adding translucency (transmission shader).



Coloring ramps - adding root to tip.

Noise texture - how big particles are.

Color ramp: hue/saturation value. Use color gradient settings to make another color with it.

If you want to keep the same color ramp values for another color, you don't need to duplicate it.
