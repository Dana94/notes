# Lighting

### Lighting with Cycles

* **Point**: size determines sharpness or softness of shadows.
* **Sun**
* **Spotlight:** like point but contained within a cone.
* **Area**: emits light from one side of a shape. Emits light only in the direction it's pointing, not behind it.
* Any object can be a light source with setting its material to emission.
* **World**: cam color our scene.

Click the dot next to the world color to select a texture to use instead. Choose the remove option to return to the default state.

The ball can be clicked and dragged to move the sun's point.

Turbidity determines how thick/thin the atmosphere is.\
Ground Albedo determines how much light is reflected back up into the sky.

* **Ambient Occlusion**: lights up everything from inside our scene.
