# Default 2D Animation

Best to rename the **object and the data** name the same.

Selecting the data bae is where you'll see the layers listed. The layer currently have mask, lock, hide, onion shown in that order for each layer.

Since we're switching form edit, object, and draw often, I checked "Tab for pie menu" so I could access them easier. Otherwise, they are at the top left of the interface under a dropdown.

When roughing out a sketch and you think it looks good, you can jump into the next frame in the same layer to finalize your drawing. Here, I'm going over my rough drawing in frame 2.

You may not need to fix the current rough sketch, so you could chose to move onto the lines layer in the same frame that the rough is in \(**so same frame, but different layer**\). Best to lighten the opacity for the rough one in this case. The rough layer's opacity isn't visible here but this is where it's adjusted.

Like for sculpting, **F** is for brush size, **shift + F** is for strength size.

Stabilize settings are under Options.

If using the stabilizer, there may be more vertices in your lines than necessary. Use Stroke &gt; Simplify to reduce these points. [Simplify Help](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/grease_pencil/modes/edit/stroke_menu.html#simplify)

Holding down shift reverses the stabilizer affect when you're drawing.

Best to autolock all layers you're not currently on.

Delete loose points option.

Each material has a stroke and a fill option.

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28108%29.png)

Using the fill tool, you could see the boundaries it will fill before even adding the color in.

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28106%29.png)

The sculpt brush can push the color into the right spot. Hit the alt key while using fill tool to create a boundary if the lines don't always create the desired boundaries for you.



If you are using the fill tool on a object with no complete boundary line, use Alt + LMB with fill enabled and the material has stoke checked. You will see a simple line drawn but it's used to encompass the color when you use fill. When you're done with the boundary, use edit mode &gt; grease pencil &gt; clean up &gt; boundary strokes.



If you want a selection of stroked to go behind others in the same layer, you can go to stroke &gt; arrange strokes &gt; send to back. This helps if the wrong colors are overlapping.
