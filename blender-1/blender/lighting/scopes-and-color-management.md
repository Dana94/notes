# Scopes and Color Management

**Filmic** gives you a higher dynamic range to work with and adjusts the saturation to behave realistically in bright areas.

**Filmic Log** uses some of the same principles as Filmic but matches some o the values like high-end cameras. It seems dull but it's not intended to be the final result. It works with editing.

**False Color** helps gauge if the color is too high or too low. A bright scene has the light areas showing a nice orange color under this setting. Turn back to Filmic when you're done with this one.
