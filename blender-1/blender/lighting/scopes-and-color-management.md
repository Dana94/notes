# Scopes and Color Management

**Filmic** gives you a higher dynamic range to work with and adjusts the saturation to behave realistically in bright areas.

**Filmic Log** uses some of the same principles as Filmic but matches some of the values like high-end cameras. It seems dull but it's not intended to be the final result. It works with editing.

**False Color** helps gauge if the color is too high or too low. A bright scene has the light areas showing a nice orange color under this setting. Turn back to Filmic when you're done with this one.

When a render image is made, go to view > sidebar to see the histogram under the Scopes tab. When the spikes are tall, it means there are more pixels in that value range. The Luma choice&#x20;

You can see the render result after closing the render image window by going to Editor Type > image editor and choosing Render Result from the dropdown. Then it can be shown in a section of the workspace. Click N to get the scopes tab again. You'll find adjusting the exposure under Render  color management will change the graph values.

You can choose the "use curves" option to brighten the brighter areas and darken the darker areas with a s-curve chape on the graph. As a general rule ,try to keep most of the values on the Luma graph more in the middle. Don't want anything completely white or black.
