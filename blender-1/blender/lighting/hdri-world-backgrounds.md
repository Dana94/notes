# HDRI World Backgrounds

HDRI - Each individual pixel of the image is its own sunlamp. The brightness of the pixel determines the strength of the lamp. The color of the pixel determines the color of the sunlamp.\
Change the world color by setting it to an environment texture and upload a HDRI file.
