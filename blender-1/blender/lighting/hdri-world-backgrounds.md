# HDRI World Backgrounds

HDRI - Each individual pixel of the image is its own sunlamp. The brightness of the pixel determines the strength of the lamp. The color of the pixel determines the color of the sunlamp.\
Change the world color by setting it to an environment texture and upload a HDRI file.

There needs to be some modifying if yo are introducing other light sources to a scene already using a light source from an HDRI image.

If you want the light source appearing in a certain way, you can change the rotation by changing the vector value t mapping and changing the rotation value for Z.

You can use built-in HDRIs in Blender to test the scene but they're not great for rendering. You can add your own here by clicking the gear icon. Under Lights > HDRIs click install.
