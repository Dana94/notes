Initially, the render will be completely black because the world view is set to be far away.

There needs to be lights within the scene to do this.

Have the point light outside of the scene in the same lane where the light is coming into the room.\
Pont: 25w, .05m in size.\
Under render > color management: exposure: 1.290.\
This will create a cool effect of a projector.\
